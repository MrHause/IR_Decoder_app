## Overview
It's project which allows users receive IR data from TV remote and see how the frame looks like. It allows users to get codes of particular buttons in remotes.
In this project has been built an device which receive InfraRed data sent from TV remote. It consist fo several parts: AVR microcontroler, IR sensor, UART converter and additional electrical elements. 
The program has been written in C language in Atmel Studio 7 environment. It receives data from TV remote and then calculate time of High and Low state of the incomming signal. The times are stored in cyclical buffer
and then are sent using UART communication to the PC. The second part of the project is PC application which receive data from device and plot signal and allow users to decode and read binary values. 
The PC application can be found there: [PC Application for IR decoder](https://bitbucket.org/MrHause/irdecoder/src/master/)
