## Overview
It's second part of the project which receive data from IR receiver device. This part can be found here: [IR receiver AVR](https://github.com/MrHause/IR_Decoder_AVR)
This application has been made in C# programming language. It listens on selected COM port. When signal is received by the device we can see in the terminal calculated times of the particulat states. User can
plot received signal and use some tools for analyse. When user know which coding type is used in remote, application can decode it to binary representation.
